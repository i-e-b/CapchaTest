Experiments with CAPTCHAs

Example animated CAPTCHA:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-e-b/CaptchaTest/master/AnimatedCaptcha.gif"/>

This is a simple value to be entered, and relies on difficulty resolving a temporal image. (in this case 159786)

Example grouping CAPTCHA:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-e-b/CaptchaTest/master/GroupingCaptcha.gif"/>

This is a query, where the user would be asked to enter certain groups in order. (such as "Please enter connected numbers left-to-right from A, then C, then B" -> 63466213451)
